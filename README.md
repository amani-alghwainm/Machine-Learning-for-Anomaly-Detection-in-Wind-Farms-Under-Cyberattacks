# Enhancing Cybersecurity in Wind Farms through Data Analytics and Machine Learning

## Overview
As wind energy adoption grows, the security of wind farms against cyberattacks becomes increasingly crucial. This research project proposes a comprehensive framework for detecting and mitigating cyber threats in wind farms using data analytics and machine learning techniques.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing and Analysis**: SCADA data from wind turbines is preprocessed, and relationships between key variables are established using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).
- **Simulation of Cyberattacks**: Four types of cyberattacks are simulated within the framework, generating labeled training data for an LSTM neural network model.
- **Machine Learning Model Development**: An LSTM model is trained to identify anomalous patterns indicative of cyberattacks, enhancing the framework's detection capabilities.

## Dataset
- **Kelmarsh dataset : Plumley, Charlie, “Kelmarsh wind farm data”. Zenodo, Feb. 01, 2022. doi: 10.5281/zenodo.5841834.

## Evaluation and Insights
The performance of the framework is rigorously evaluated, and insights derived from the evaluation process are utilized for refining the framework further.

## Impact
This project contributes significantly to advancing cybersecurity practices in the renewable energy sector, specifically in enhancing the security and resilience of wind farms against evolving cyber threats.
